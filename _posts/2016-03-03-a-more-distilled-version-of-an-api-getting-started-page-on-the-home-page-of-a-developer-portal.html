<p>As I look through API portals, profiling the building blocks of successful API platform, I'm always looking for bite-size stories for my readers. I was working to complete my Instagram API definition, as part of <a href="http://photos.stack.network/">my photo API research</a>, and their getting started graphic caught my attention.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/developer/">This three step getting started visual for Instagram is prominently available on the home page</a>, providing a very distilled down version of <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks/">what I recommend API providers usually accomplish with a dedicated getting started page</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/developer/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Instagram-Developer-Getting-Started.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" /></a></p>
<p>The featured getting started area provides you with the link to register your application, and overview on authentication and authorization, and a link to all the endpoints, so you can start making requests. I am a big fan of there always being a dedicated getting started page for APIs that I am on-boarding with, but I am always a bigger fan when someone distills these building blocks into something that is way easier to understand, and execute--without all the blah blah blah.</p>
<p><a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks/">I'm going to consider adding a feature getting started building block, in addition to having the dedicated page</a>. When done right, I think they can accomplsh the same thing, but with one less click--reducing any friction we possibly can in the on-boarding process.</p>
